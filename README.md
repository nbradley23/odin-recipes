For this project I was simulating creating a recipe website using my favorite recipes I use most often at home. I used the index.html as my homepage and linked all my recipes to it in an <ul> to add some organization to the links. I also added a gif to the homepage. On all three recipe pages I utilized the same layout for each using the different heading tags for the different sections of the page. I used lists for both the ingredients sections and the steps sections. At the bottom of each recipe page I added a <a> to provide a link to return to the homepage (index.html). Each recipe page also utilized a <img> to show the viewer a picture of the finished product to catch their attention.
